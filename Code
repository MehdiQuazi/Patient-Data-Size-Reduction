%This is all run in MATLAB.
%The real patient data folder contains the MRI data in the form of a NIfTI file. This data was obtained by the full MRI protocol.
%Because we are assessing the impact of shortened MRI acquisition protocols and comparing it to the full protocol, we must reduce the size of the
MRI data before we can process it with the acquisition protocol specific-deep learning models we have trained.

%Load the data by defining the pathway to it
I_nii = load_untouch_nii('D:/');I = I_nii.img;

%Re-define the size of the data
I_sub1 = I (:,:,:,[Define here according to the text file volumes/numbering]);

%An example below
I_sub1 = I (:,:,:,[1:4 9:12 17:20 25:28 33:36 41:72 108:125 148:153]);

%Find the new size of the data
size(I_sub1)

%Define new size
I_nii.hdr.dime.dim(5) = (enter the size given once you run the line above);

%Save the new (reduced) MRI data
I_nii.img = I_sub1;
save_untouch_nii(I_nii,'Edit file name here');

%This new MRI data can then be processed with the deep learning model code.
